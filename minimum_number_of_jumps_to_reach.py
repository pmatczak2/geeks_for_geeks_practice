# Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element.
# Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element).
# If an element is 0, they cannot move through that element. If the end isnâ€™t reachable, return -1.

# Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
# Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 9 -> 9)
# Explanation: Jump from 1st element
# to 2nd element as there is only 1 step,
# now there are three options 5, 8 or 9.
# If 8 or 9 is chosen then the end node 9
# can be reached. So 3 jumps are made.
